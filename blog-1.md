##  **What Are Union Types?**

Union types are used when a value can be more than a single type. Union types are defined using the pipe ( `|` ) operator and allow a value to conform to multiple possible types. 

```example:
const  person = (params: string | number): void => {
    console.log(`The value is: ${params}`);
}

```
 Here, the `value` parameter can be either a `string` or a `number`

 ### Why Union Types Are Significant

 Union types make it easy to work with functions or variables that need to accept a range of inputs.Union types are used when a value can be more than a single type.

## **What Are Intersection Types?**

Intersection types in TypeScript allow developers to combine multiple types into one using the (`&`) operator. The resulting type includes all properties from the intersected types, ensuring that any variable or object satisfies every condition of the combined types.

```Example
type Type1 = { property1: string };
type Type2 = { property2: number };

type CombinedType = Type1 & Type2;

const example: CombinedType = {
    property1: "Hello",
    property2: 42,
};
```
### Why Use Intersection Types?
- Enforce Multiple Constraints: Ensure objects meet all required conditions.
- Model Complex Objects: Create objects that share properties from different domains.
- Promote Reusability: Combine smaller, reusable types into more complex ones.

### Why Intersection Types Are Significant

Intersection types are a cornerstone of TypeScript's type system, helping developers enforce strict and expressive type definitions. Use them to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.
